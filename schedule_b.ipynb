    "In line with Tuesday's panel around \"autocoders,\" we'll demonstrate how to use text descriptions to predict codes. Along the way, we'll show some good practice when practicing machine learning. While this notebook will focus on coding products using descriptions, this approach should work for many scenarios where one has a dataset with both text descriptions and their associated codes.\n",

    "Specifically, this is the \"concordance file\" for the Harmonized System's import/export codes. This gives us the code and a description of what products fit into that code: perfect for the sort of automatic coding we want to do. We've included the file here (in the `data/` subfolder) for ease-of-use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The import and export codes are slightly different at the 10-digit level; however, the codes are heirarchical and at the 6-digit level they are the same (as defined by an international standards group). We'll model at an even less granular level than that - the 4-digit level - based on the amount of data that we have.\n",

    "Now that we've split up our data, we can choose a classifier. We'll use one of the simplest out there: Logistic Regression, often known as \"logit.\" Normally, logistic regression is a binary classifier. In our case, because we're categorizing something like 1200 codes, we'll actually be training 1200 models, and selecting the highest-probability prediction. This is known as \"one-vs-all\". There are other voting schemes to convert binary classifiers into multi-class classifiers.\n",

    "One more trick: instead of using the closed-form logistic regression classifier, we'll use a heuristic optimization approach that runs much more quickly and efficiently, called \"stochastic gradient descent.\" SGD, as it's abbreviated, is part of the core technique used to optimize neural nets (back-propagation or \"backprop\") as well. We'll leave it to you to convince yourself that this approach is just as good. You can get into the math or just try it out in Python!"
